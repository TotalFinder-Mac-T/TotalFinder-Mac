## Overview

<a href="#">TotalFinder</a> delivers essential Finder improvements through an interface designed for both simplicity and depth. The application serves power users, developers, and professionals who need more from macOS file management than stock Finder provides.

The <a href="#">colored labels</a> enhance visual organization beyond standard tags. Apply color coding that stands out more prominently than native label implementation.

<a href="#">Narrow tabs</a> option fits more tabs in limited window width. Manage many open locations without horizontal scrolling through tab bar.

<a href="#">Tab shortcuts</a> navigate between tabs using keyboard commands. Switch locations quickly without mouse interaction.

The <a href="#">browser-style navigation</a> adds back and forward buttons for folder history. Navigate previously visited locations with familiar browser controls.

<a href="#">Copy path</a> functionality extracts full file paths easily. Get complete paths for Terminal use, scripts, or documentation.

<a href="#">Context menu enhancements</a> add useful options to right-click menus. Access TotalFinder features directly from contextual menus.

<a href="#">Assign shortcuts</a> to any menu item throughout Finder. Customize keyboard access to frequently used commands.

<a href="#">Transparent window</a> option shows desktop through inactive Finder windows. Keep awareness of background content while browsing files.

<a href="#">Native integration</a> enhances Finder rather than replacing it. Maintain familiar Finder behavior while adding professional features.
